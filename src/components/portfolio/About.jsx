                    I'm a practical, no-nonsense engineer who loves turning complex problems
                    into simple, logical solutions. I thrive on breaking down challenges into
                    manageable pieces, solving them with clear thinking and efficient execution.
                    My approach is straightforward: understand the problem, map out the steps,
                    and build solutions that just work.

                    I bring clarity to chaos. Whether it's debugging a tricky issue or designing
                    a system from scratch, I focus on what matters most—delivering results that
                    are reliable and easy to understand. My ability to simplify without
                    sacrificing quality makes me a go-to problem-solver.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    I’m always learning, adapting, and building with the right tools for the
                    job. Let’s create something impactful together.
